## Gege's Confectionaries

I am building confectionaries shop where you can order cakes and go through the various sweet and savory options built with React. The backend is built with


```
Features:
- A customer can select a product based on its category
-  A customer can add a product to the cart
- A customer can send their submit their order and their prefered payment method
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`


### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
